/*
Here be dragons. Because this is a fairly expensive process, it's
optimised heavily. Be careful in here.

This solution guarantees a minimum of desiredLength RMIds from each
added permutation are included in the result. It may not be optimal,
but it's more important to be fast that to find the absolute minimum
solution.

The gist of the approach is to assume that every RMId of every
permutation is in the result to start with. We then sort the result by
frequency of each RMId and then walk through starting at the
rarest. For each RMId, if we can remove it from the result without
taking any of the permutations that include this RMId below the
desiredLength (i.e. the number of elements of the permutation that
appear in the result), then we do so.

OverProvision represents the number of RMIds of a permutation included
in the result above the desiredLength.

We do a few tricks to make this as fast as possible:
- in maps, where the value would normally be a list, we use a pointer
  to a list so that we can append to the list (and perhaps change the
  list itself) without having to rewrite into the map.
- when we create lists, we give them a generous capacity to start with
  to reduce the number of times they have to grow.

These tricks and many other aspects of the design are based on the
benchmark results with cpu profiling.
